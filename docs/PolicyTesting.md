# Unit Test Policy

## 1. Layout and Design:
- Check that the layout matches the design specifications.
- Verify that fonts, colors, and styles are consistent across the application.
- Ensure images and icons are displayed correctly without distortion.

## 2. Navigation and Workflow:
- Test all navigation links (buttons, menus) to ensure they lead to the correct pages.
- Verify that the back, forward, and refresh functions work as expected.
- Check the usability of menus, dropdowns, and other interactive elements.

## 3. Forms and Data Entry:
- Validate form inputs for correctness and error handling (e.g., required fields, data type validation).
- Check the behavior of form submissions (success and error messages).
- Ensure that default values are set correctly if applicable.

## 4. Functionality:
- Test all interactive elements like buttons, and clickable images.
- Ensure all functionalities perform as expected under different conditions.
- Check for proper functionality of features like search, sort, filter, etc.

## 5. Responsive and Cross-Browser Testing:
- Verify that the UI adjusts correctly for different screen sizes and orientations.
- Ensure that the application works and appears as expected across different browsers.

## 6. Performance:
- Test the UI's response time for different actions.

## 7. Automated Testing with Jest:
- Write Jest tests for UI components, covering functional and visual aspects of components.
- Use Jest to verify components continue to render as expected if there are changes made.
- Use Jest for simulating and testing user interactions within components. Ensure all event handlers and state changes behave as expected under test conditions.
- Write Jest tests to validate workflows complete successfully.
